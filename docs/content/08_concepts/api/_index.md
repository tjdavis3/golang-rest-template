This API is based on simple REST principles.   The API endpoints return JSON responses and are defined using the OpenAPI specification which makes the generation of client SDK much easier.

## Requests

The API is based on REST principles. Data resources are accessed via standard HTTPS requests in UTF-8 format to an API endpoint. Where possible, the API uses appropriate HTTP verbs for each action:

METHOD |	ACTION
------ | ---------
GET |	Retrieves resources
POST |	Creates resources
PUT |	Changes and/or replaces resources or collections in their entirety
PATCH |  Changes a portion of a resource
DELETE	 |Deletes resources

## Responses

The API returns all response data as a JSON object. See the Web API Object Model for a description of all the retrievable objects.

## Timestamps

Timestamps are returned in ISO 8601 format as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) with a zero offset: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ.
